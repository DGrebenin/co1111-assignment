### TESTING - Leaderboard
For the testing part, we implemented one another HTML5 page called "test.html",
and a new Javascript File named "testing.js" which are 
linked together. In the "testing.js" exist one function called "testingLeaderboard".
The function  calls assychronous the Test-leaderboard from the API.
This API has a "fixed" leaderboard which we output in a table.
