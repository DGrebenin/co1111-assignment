<!--<p>Feedback from the people who tested our web app-->
<p>The web app was given to some members of team two and also to common people, for <b>"black box testing"</b> in order to identify and fix mistakes.
    The common suggestion from all people who tested the game is to improve the design when the quiz starts. Moreover, the common people that have no relation with the Uclan,
    cannot answer some questions. Despite of the above, they did not identify any usability issues.</p>

<h4>" It's a game and it has answers on the bottom. I suggest a hint button
    at the bottom instead of the answer.
    Everytime we get an answer wrong the game wants us to get the right answer. I suggest that if you get it wrong move on to the next question.
    Because everytime you get it wrong you get a minus on your points(I assume this was intended).
    The layout is good"| Ermina,20</h4>
