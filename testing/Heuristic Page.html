<h2 class="headers">User Acceptance Plan:</h2>

<!--<p>Feedback from the people who tested our web app-->
<p>The web app was given to some members of team two and also to common people, for <b>"black box testing"</b> in order to identify and fix mistakes.
    The common suggestion from all people who tested the game is to improve the design when the quiz starts. Moreover, the common people that have no relation with the Uclan,
    cannot answer some questions. Despite of the above, they did not identify any usability issues.</p>
